// Write a Javascript snippet to do each of the following. 
// Make your best guess if you don't know. 
// Make sure to put some sort of response on each:

let x = 5
let y = 2
let a = "H"
let b = "i"

// Add two numbers
z = x + y

// Multiply two numbers
z = x * y

// Subtract one from a number
z = x - y

// concatinate two strings together.
z = a + b

// assign a value to a variable
let c = 1

// increment the value in a variable by 3
c = c + 3

// compare two values to see if they are the same
x == y

// check to see if one number is less than another number
x < y

// Check to see if two values are NOT equal
x != y

// check to see if a value is less than 10 and greater than 0
0 < x < 10
